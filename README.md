# Requirements
1. **Input Directory**  
  - All input files will be located in a directory named `INPUT`.  
  - Files will have the extension `.txt`.  
  - Your program should process all `.txt` files in this directory.

2. **Spaces in Cipher Text**  
  - For simplicity, spaces should be passed through unchanged to the cipher text. In other words, all word breaks in the original text will be visible in the cipher text and should remain visible in the decrypted output.

2. **Decryption Methods**  
   Use or implement publicly available decryption methods for the following ciphers:
   - Caesar cipher
   - Vigenère cipher
   - One additional substitution cipher of your choice (for example, Affine, Playfair, Hill, Autokey, etc).
   
   **Note:** Exclude any ciphers that are simplifications of the first two given ciphers above. For example, ROT1, ROT13, and other Caesar cipher variants with specific shift values should not be chosen as they are well-known simplifications of the Caesar cipher.

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Determine the **5 best decryptions overall** across all input files and ciphers.  
   - For the Vigenère cipher, you can assume that the key length will be at most four characters (e.g., B, BE, BOP, Bop1, etc.). Similar restrictions may be assumed for any cipher with high time or memory complexity.
   - Restrict the evaluation alphabet to:
    ```
    a..z A..Z 0..9 . : ; ' ! ?
    ```
   **Note:** Spaces are always passed through and visible in the cipher and decrypted text
4. **Output Format**  
   - Save the 5 best decryptions in a single file named `output.md`.
   - The `output.md` file should be structured as follows:
     - Each **input file** should have a **top-level section** (e.g., `# input1.txt`).
     - Under each input file section, include up to the best decryptions for that file as **second-level sections** (e.g., `## Decryption 1: Caesar Cipher`).
     - For each decryption, include:
       - The cipher used
       - The score or a summary of how well the decryption matches the chosen heuristic (e.g., letter distribution, dictionary matches)
       - The decrypted text itself (in a code block or clearly separated)
   - Example Output:
     ```
     # input1.txt
     ## Decryption 1: Caesar Cipher
     - Cipher: Caesar
     - Score: 0.85 (high match to English letter frequency)
     - Summary: Most words are dictionary valid.
     Decrypted text here...
     
     ## Decryption 2: Vigenère Cipher
     - Cipher: Vigenère
     - Score: 0.65 (moderate match to English letter frequency)
     - Summary: Some words are valid, some are not.
     Decrypted text here...

     # input2.txt
     ... (repeat for remaining input files and decryptions)
     ```

## Expected Behavior
- The program scans all `.txt` files in `INPUT`.
- Each file is decrypted using the specified cipher techniques.
- Candidate decryptions are scored and ranked.
- The top 5 overall are included in `output.md`, grouped by their source input filename.

## Output Format (Summary)
- All output is consolidated into a single `output.md` file.
- Organized by input file, with best decryptions as subsections.
- Each decryption includes the cipher used, a score or summary, and the full decrypted text.

## Notes
- Ensure your program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, spaces (which are always passed through and visible), and the given symbols consistently.
- Always use the alphabet exactly as given in `3. Evaluation` and in the Example below.
- Design your scoring mechanism to fairly evaluate likelihood of correctness (e.g., letter frequencies, dictionary matching, n-gram analysis).
- The additional substitution cipher you choose should be clearly documented in your code.
- Include metadata at the top of each output file, such as:
  - Source file name
  - Cipher used
  - Score/ranking
- For the Vigenère cipher, you can assume that the key length will be at most four characters (e.g., B, BE, BOP, Bop1, etc.).
  Similar restrictions may be assumed for any cipher with high time or memory complexity.

## Example: Caesar Cipher with Shift 7

Given the alphabet:
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789.:;'!?
```

Plaintext:
```
the quick brown fox jumps over thirteen lazy dogs...
```

Cipher text (Caesar, shift 7):
